Python Notebook that traverses through the files in the zipped folder (Engineering Test Files) and generates the combined.csv file also found in that folder

Write a Python Notebook that traverses through the files in the zipped folder (Engineering Test Files) and generates the combined.csv file also found in that folder. 

When writing the code:

    a.	Try to make it as generic as possible such that if a new file called NA Preview.csv gets dropped in the same folder, the script will be able to process it and rows in the combined.csv file will be added with the environment value being set to NA Preview. 
    b.	Same applies if a new file called Asia Prod 4.csv gets dropped. It should add new rows to the combined.csv file with the environment being set to Asia Prod
    c.	Use best coding practices and write production ready code.
